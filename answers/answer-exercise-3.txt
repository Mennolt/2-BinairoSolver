IDNR2 = 1769626

DATA = 2021-10-18

## Answer

1. Thanks to lazy evaluation, only the computations until the first triplet or line with an empty cell is found 
   are actually computed. After that it does not compute more.
2. This is actually stil inefficient when filling up the whole field: There is a Schlemiels painter situation here.
   When halfway through the puzzle, it is possible the first half of the puzzle is solved. 
   Every time the findLocs looks for the next open spot, it has to conclude for each triple/line in the first half
   that that one has no empty spots, resulting in lots of duplicate work.
3. In the first command, solution is never used thus never computed. 
   In the second it needs to actually be computed and then suddenly it takes very long.
